# Project Title

Bidfinity - Bidding made easy

# Project Description

This project is a frontend application built with React and Tailwind CSS. It provides a frontend UI for the bidfinity features from User registration to simple bidding system, communicating to backend through RESTful API.

# Prerequisites

1. Node.js and npm installed on your machine

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Install dependencies:
   `cd [project-directory]`
   `npm install`

# Configuration

1. Rename the .env.example file to .env.
2. Open the .env file and provide the necessary configuration values for your backend API URL.

# Usage

To start the server, run the following command:

### `npm start`

The server will start running on http://localhost:3000 or any port you configure, i.e PORT=4000 npm start.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
